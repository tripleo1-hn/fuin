### What is it?

Elijjah is a high-level language suitable for replacement of Java and C++. It is meant to integrate into current C and Java projects.

### Why?

Before Python (2), then Ruby, got popular, and things started changing (Rust?), there was no other real choice except Java, and for various reasons that didn't catch on.

I wanted something that was:

* simple to parse
    
* quick to compile
    
* works everywhere
    

(more later)

### Does it work?

Not yet.
